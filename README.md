# conformal-mapping

This is a repository to store some experiments with conformal mapping. Please assume that nothing is 'correct' or free of bugs.

I will likely be using Pluto notebooks, which will contain a description of the mathematical basis behind the code. I have found that this helps me to proceed slowly, and to think before I code.

**Note:** To run a Pluto notebook please follow the steps here https://plutojl.org/#install

### 1. shwarzchristoffel.jl

This Pluto notebook attempts to follow the algorithm described in _Shwarz Christoffel Mapping_ (2005) by Driscoll and Trefethen.

It is designed to enable conformal mapping of the unit disc to an arbitrary bounded polygon.
